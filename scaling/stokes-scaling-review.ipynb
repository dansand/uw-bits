In modelling a fluid system, one typically chooses a similar Rayleigh number (while individual dimensional paramters that enter the Rayleigh number may be altered any order of magnitude).\n",

    "As Louis has pointed out to me, the uncertainty in upper mantle / asthenosphere viscosity might be on the order of an 1 order of magnitude. Meanwhile plate velocities (instaneous, as well as long-term-average) are much better constrained. His point is that the upper mantle viscocity should be treated as the unknown, while 'real' (earth) times are simply fixed to representative values, e.g a couple of million years for a portion of the slab to sink through the upper mantle. Nevertheless, the conversion between viscosity and timescales is still non-unique, as the examples above demonstrate.\n",
    "\n",
    "###Length scales\n",
    "\n",
    "It is fairly typical in Underworld subduction models to use a vertical model domain length of 1, representing 1000 km in earth. This means that typical old lithsophere is about 0.1 model units wide. \n",
    "\n",
    "I chose a length scaling based on the 1 model unit being equal to 1 unit of longitude at the equator (111 km). I like this scaling partly because you doen have to use s many small numbers when dealing the lithsohere (i.e, the lithsohere thickness is ~ 1 unit), an also becaus you the 660 km discontinuity can be enforced at 6 model units beneath the surface. I also think that this scaling convenction might to an easier transition to spherical coordinates. \n",
    "\n",
    "###Densities\n",
    "\n",
    "Should we ever use zero density? As in the Ozbench model, it has been common to set the upper mantle density to zero in Underworld subduction models (and furthermore to use a uniform lithospher density of 1). Numerically, this is fine, but one problem with this is that typcal crust is lighter than typical upper mantle peridotite. So if you want to resolve the crust, an you use this scaling, crustal densities should be negative. Using zero densities for materials seems to result in zero (increase) in lithostatic pressure throughout these domains, which has implications for any pressure dependent rheologies we might want to explore. \n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of this, I used an arbitrary density value of say ~2500 kg/m3 to 'normalize' my model densities, given that this is typically lighter than any rock values that might be expected to have a significant effect on subduction. Hence keeping all density values positive. Futher review of this may be needed after more experimentation with 'sticky' air models. "
